# Monster of the Week

A simple Foundry VTT system for Monster of the Week.

TODO:
- Add a compendium pack for moves:

  - https://foundryvtt.com/api/Compendium.html
- Fonts:
  - The book uses https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/protype/lavah-pro/grunge/
    - Similar free fonts: https://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=107
  - Handwriting fonts for the ratings values:
    https://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=605&text=%2B1+-2+%2B3+0
  - Typewriter fonts for names:
    https://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=113&text=Kick+Some+Ass
  - Copy text in the book:

- Moves:
  - Structure the 10+/7-9/fail text so it can be displayed in chat
  - Would be cool to automatically add holds, though that could get
    annoying if most of the holds are used immediately; may be better
    to do it in chat with a button to remember the hold for later.
  - Some gear can provide custom moves. Would be nice if owning that gear
    added the move to the owner's list.
  - Leveling up can change basic moves to Advanced Moves (p122) which gives
    them extra effects on 12+.
- Hunter specials
  - The Hex's Rotes (spells). Could treat them as special
    moves, since they follow from Use Magic, or could create a new type
    of thing for them. Could still appear in the Moves tab, just under
    a Rotes section
  - Pararomantic's "Relationship status" track
- Armor
  - Would be nice to roll up all armor into a single top-level view,
    adding all N-armor and highlight tags like 'magic'. Clicking on it
    would switch to the gear/armor tab.
